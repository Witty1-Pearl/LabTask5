METHOD OVERLOADING:
Method overloading in c-sharp refers to defining multiple methods with the same name but different parameters.
Method overloading can be executed by changing the number of arguements and data type of the arguements.
To overload a method in c-sharp; we define another method with the same name but with different signatures;
Method overloading is also called COMPILED TIME POLYMORPHISM or EARLY BINDING.

METHOD OVERRIDING:
Method overriding means override a base class method in the derived class by creating a method with the same name
and signatures to perform different task. In c-sharp the method override is achieved by using the keywords; OVERRIDE 
and VIRTUAL. This is also known as RUN TIME POLYMORPHISM or LATE BINDING.

FINAL NOTE:
Basically, the key difference to note between method overloading from method overriding is that;
*Method Overloading: means defining multiple methods with the same name but with the different parameters.
*Method Overriding: means override a base class method in the derived class by creating a method with the sme name and 
parameters using virtual and override keywords.
